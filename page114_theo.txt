Acknowledgments


Thanks to…

Therése Janlén Ressel – My beautiful wife and partner in crime and adventures who always takes time to give me feedback on things I write and supports me regardless if I occupy our dining table with lego, spends 1 week a month away on Iceland or writes book into the late nights.

Special thanks to my friend and colleague Hans Brattberg for encouraging me to publish this book on Google Drive. Turned out the be of awesome value and much fun.

My colleagues at Crisp – For their supportive cheering, generous sharing of ideas, experiences and knowledge, and for relentless and valuable feedback. 

All my clients – For allowing me to be a small part of your agile journey and for all the learning opportunities you have offered me. A very special thanks to Spotify and Plain Vanilla. Spending time with you, learning from you, fighting together with you, and being challenged by you have had a tremendous impact on me. I’ve grown so much thanks to you.
