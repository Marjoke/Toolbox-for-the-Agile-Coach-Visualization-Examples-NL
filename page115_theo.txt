Acknowledgments (cont)
Big thanks Yves Hanoulle, Rolf F. Katzenberger and Bart Coelus for great feedback and suggestions through Google Drive comments. Many thanks to these online contributors too: Hafþór Bryndísarson, Edward Dahllöf, Martin Zehle, Erik Buitenhuis, Arlo Belshee, Conor Moyne, Pierre Neis, Tobias Modig and Tomas Nilsson.

A special thanks to Marlowe Klingvall, who took time to read and give me invaluable feedback on grammar and spelling for every single page.

And finally, thanks to all the curious anonymous animals that came by to read the online Google Drive version of this book: Koala, Crow, Ibex, Jackal, Iguana and Kraken. And Rabbit. And Manatee and Cormorant. And Turtle, Panda, Axolotl, Wolf, Sheep and Otter. Oh, I almost forgot; Dingo, Giraffe, Squirrel, Skunk and Bat.

And everyone else I’ve missed to mention.

Thank you all!
