Visualize your policies

Make your policies, routines, working agreements and rules explicit and visible. Create posters or dedicate a portion of your whiteboard wall to your rules.

Making the policies explicit and visible forces you to come to a shared understanding within the team. It also gives you something concrete to refer to when youâ€™re discussing how to improve your way of working. Every policy should also have an expiration date (3-6 months into the future). When a policy expires, review it! Make a conscious decision to keep, modify or to abandon it.

Yet another tip is to skip the bottom line and add an empty bullet, signaling that there is more to come.
