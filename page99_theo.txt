Guide Board

Capture the working agreement policies from retrospectives by drawing and writing on Post-its. Actually portraying the policy in a drawing makes the policy easier to remember, stirs great discussions and makes the Guide Board easier to read for the team. For each, sprint add a new column. 

If a policy is poorly followed, push the Post-it down to the “Under Observation” row. In the next retro evaluate your ability to follow the policy, and then either put it back into its place or close it with a blue note.

When a policy becomes replaced or deprecated, put a blue sticker on the policy. The front of the blue Post-it states the sprint during which it became obsolete and the back side of the Post-it describes the reason why it became deprecated.
